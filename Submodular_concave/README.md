Link to the paper: "".

In this project, we try to solve the minimax problems considering general possibly non-smooth submodular-concave objective functions using a ZO extra gradient (ZO EG) algorithm with the aim of finding $\epsilon$-saddle points of the cost function.

This folder contains a Python notebook file:

"subM_Conc.ipynb" includes the implementations of the ZO EG algorithm for the offline and online robust semi supervised clustering of dataset sampled from two moon dataset.
