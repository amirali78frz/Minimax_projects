In this project, we try to solve the minimax problem considering general smooth non-convex non-concave objective functions using a generalised extra grdaient algorithm with the aim of relating the saddle points of the objective function to the limit points of the algorithm.

This folder contains two Python notebook files and a Mathematica code file:
