This folder contains the code files used in the paper titled "Properties of Fixed Points of Generalised Extra Gradient Methods Applied to Min-Max Problems".

In this project, we try to solve the minimax problem considering general smooth non-convex non-concave objective functions using a generalised extra grdaient algorithm with the aim of relating the saddle points of the objective function to the limit points of the algorithm.

This folder contains two Python notebook files and a Mathematica code file:

"L-CSS.ipynb" includes the implementations of the GEG algorithms for the first two numerical examples: (1) "Fixed points of GEG applied to f (x, y) = xy" and (2) "Fixed points of GEG applied to a function with multiple critical points".

"GEG_NN.ipynb" provides the implementation of the GEG algorithms for the third numerical example (Large Scale Robust Optimisation).

"L-CSS.nb" contains the Mathemartica code used in the proof of Theorem 4.
