This folder contains the code files used in the paper titled "Min-Max Optimisation for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Functions Using a Random Zeroth-Order Extragradient Algorithm"..

Link to the paper: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07388".

In this project, we try to solve the minimax problem considering functions satisfying the weak minty variational inequalities using the Gaussian random zeroth-order oracles and a zeorth-order extra grdaient algorithm in constrained, unconstrained, and non-smooth settings.
